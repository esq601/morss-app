# Web Apps and Cloud
## Modern Application Development

In this repo you will find two Shiny app files.  One, *morss_app* is the data input application and *morss_display* is the dashboard application.

These **will not** run out of the box.  I have not commited the connection information to the mongoDB and blob storage account as part of this example.  However, you can see the structure of the application and how they are initially setup.

If you are able to set up an Azure Blob Store and CosmosDB with Mongo API and provide the credentials, these applications should then be functional.
